Damage is quite poor and power at medium range is mediocre, - it is advised to get as close as possible to the target and aim for the head to get a kill within a single shot. The two-shell capacity is a heavy drawback, therefore it is highly advised to aim precisely when shooting as it would avoid reloading for nothing, especially since the animation is quite long. The damage per shot quickly degrades at short range unlike other shotguns, making the weapon helpful exclusively for close-quarters combat. Even worse, the accuracy is poor and the lack of proper iron sights make the weapon anything but suited for fighting in open areas.
Although its effectiveness against NPCs is debatable, it is effective against mutants: a single pull of the trigger is usually enough to kill a dog or a boar at close range - which is helpful as the starting levels usually spawn these mutants. Its small capacity is a problem as well when it comes to fighting multiple mutants.

Despite its large weight, complex mechanism and considerable cost it is in demand in the Zone due to its effectiveness against mutants.
The SPSA-14 is a dual-mode tactical shotgun (capable of both pump action and semi-auto fire), appearing in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat.
The weapon is powerful at close range, but is quite heavy at 4.4 kg. Unlike other shotguns in the game, it is semi-automatic, yet still fires slowly at the rate a pump-action shotgun shoots (it can fire with decent speed, but it has huge recoil while shooting as fast as possible).
The SPSA-14 is relatively unpopular because other weapons like assault rifles have better damage over range. It is still popular with some players and is generally considered an improvement over the Sawn-off dbl barrel. It has a greater spread and recoil and a bit less damage than the Chaser 13.

Rare in the Zone and is used primarily to clear closed spaces of mutants.
The Eliminator has by default a 12-round mag capacity. It has a fairly high fire rate and can fire slugs as well as buckshots. The Eliminator is the only shotgun that could be mounted with a SUSAT scope and any of its variants.
The Eliminator has by far the best overall stats out of any shotgun, losing only in handling to other shotguns (excluding the Predator, which has slightly more damage and is practically matched in accuracy) - and tied with the Hunting rifle for damage per shell. Surprisingly it weighs less than the SPSA-14, as it does in real life. Its most lacking area is accuracy - it has a fairly wide spread, roughly on par with a stock Hunting rifle. Using the sights, however, gives roughly a 20% boost to accuracy and slightly dampens recoil. Notably, even when fully upgraded for accuracy, the Eliminator''s actual accuracy with buckshot and slugs alike is in fact lower than the SPSA-14 and Chaser 13, despite having a supposedly higher stat in-game. This is because accuracy is calculated from several variables like actual accuracy, recoil, etc. It is outclassed in accuracy by the Carabiner which, with upgrades, can get a similar fire rate, full-auto fire mode and same capacity.
Despite this, it''s still a very good shotgun for the early to mid-game, although one may opt for the Predator in later parts of the game as it offers better damage per shot.', 'eliminator.png');

The 9x19 ammo is a very common round, making it a useful weapon against rookie and experienced stalkers equipped with sub-par weaponry. However, it will eventually outlive its usefulness due to its low powered nature, though it is still useful against most mutants due to its good stopping power and high fire rate. While the 9x19mm round is available in FMJ varieties, the round still does little against adversaries wearing medium armor or above (example, it will normally take up to 400 rounds to kill an exoskeleton-equipped NPC, on easy difficulty). The weapon is effective against unarmored or lightly armored Stalkers, like Bandits. It is also effective against mutants and is very controllable, even when fired on fully automatic. The weapon is relatively accurate and can be used against certain armored foes if the user can achieve headshots. It may serve as a useful alternatives to shotguns thanks to its range, rate of fire and good performance in close quarters. Its low weight and corresponding ammo''s low weight make it desirable as an emergency back up automatic.

Additionally it can also be looted from a body in Lab X-18 during the following special mission in the Dark Valley. However it is also possible for the player to obtain a scope for the Obokan even before that when entering the Dark Valley, which results in a better weapon than the IL 86, being lighter and more accurate. The required 5.56x45mm ammunition for the IL 86 is also rare in the Dark Valley, while there will be plenty for the AC-96/2. Therefore the IL 86 is less useful at this part of the game.', 'il86.png');

It is designed for the BM 17, the Chaser 13 and the SPSA14 shotguns. It is most effective at ranges under 30 metres

The 12x70mm Buckshot is probably the most popular shells used by shotguns. It is 12 Gauge / 18.5mm (0.729") wide and 70mm (2.75") long. It contains 9 0.36" spherical pellets, which exit the barrel of a shotgun in a cone shaped pattern when fired.

Buckshot rounds are extremely deadly during initial velocity and are able to waste any unarmored stalker in a single shot, the sheer impact of the shells are also enough to stun anyone lucky enough to survive the shot. However the pellets have poor penetration as their spherical shape and light weight prevents them from properly piercing armor at range. Any stalker possessing heavy armor or at long range will most definitely survive a continuous volley unless shot in the head or worn down with a wasteful volley of buckshot. They are most effective against mutants, who do not posses armor and who heavily rely on melee combat.

12x70 Buckshot has the lowest penetration statistic of any munition in the game, making its performance against armor extremely low, and leaving it unable to penetrate any kind of cover, even some underbrush. On the other hand, it is more likely to stun or kill a target with a direct hit at close range due to it firing multiple pellets with each shot.

The buckshot is likely the most effective ammunition against mutants, due to the multiple pellets. Up-close, the player may even score a one-hit kill against weak mutants such as dogs.

Keep in mind that like other types of shotgun ammo, 12x70mm buckshot is much heavier pr. cartridge compared to pistol and intermediate rifle rounds. Considering how easy it may be to obtain buckshot at the start of a game, while it can be an economical way of dealing with unarmored targets, always consider how much it is necessary to carry, even more so than with other types of ammo.', '12x70_buckshot.png');

It is a solid bullet rather than a cluster of lead shot. Rather than piercing, these lead slugs simply punch through armor.

Slugs have none of the disadvantages of regular buckshot, and have decent penetration and velocity. As an advantage, it has lower air resistance than assault rifle rounds, making it more accurate and giving it longer range than buckshot. It has only slightly higher penetration than standard assault rifle ammunition, making it barely useful against human opponents. However, as it only fires a single projectile, careful aim must be taken in order to use effectively, and in fact, turns the entire idea of a shotgun on its head. While in theory, slugs and darts should allow for near-sniper-like performance, one must remember that unless specifically upgraded for single projectile munition, shotguns have much lower accuracy than rifles, as well as much cruder iron sights, making long-range fighting with these munition types difficult.

It is most effective against humans with little to no armor and is ineffective against mutants.

An important thing to note though, is that amongst common ammunition, 12x76 slugs are some of the heaviest bullets the player can acquire, and can surprisingly quickly overencumber a player.', '12x76_slug.png');

It is a heavy, relatively slow pistol round. Unlike other pistol munitions, it has higher air resistance, making the projectile slow down and lose altitude quicker. This lessens its effectiveness at longer ranges, but it still performs well against most types of enemies due to its power.

.45 handguns are a lot more effective than 9x18 or 9x19 pistols as they have a much higher penetration power, making them more effective against armored opponents. On the other hand, 9x18 and 9x19 are a lot more common, and perform better at medium to long ranges. Overall, the 9x18 and 9x19 are better to use in the early parts of each game as most of the foes will be using light armor, whereas .45 suit better the opposition by the later parts of the game.', '45acp_rounds.png');

It has the worst armour penetration statistic of any bullet - against Berill-5M, its damage becomes a mere fraction, 15%.

The 9x18mm FMJ is the standard 9x18mm ammunition type in all games. Therefore, it is easily found as most NPCs using 9x18mm weapons will carry the ammunition, and is commonly available from most traders.

These changes ensure that the rifle is a first-rate example of a modern weapon - lightweight, reliable and ergonomic.
The GP37 sports an internal scope, making it very viable as a marksman weapon. Accuracy is good, recoil is relatively low and the damage per shot makes it multipurpose on all ranges. Significant downsides, however, include that its reload time is quite long compared to other weapons of its class, and that it cannot mount a grenade launcher nor a suppressor. Also, due to its high rate of fire (actually highest of all other assault rifles and automatic weapons in general) it is the most unreliable weapon in game (even worse than Viper 5 in that respect, which is also one of the least reliable weapons in game) and its condition bar depletes visibly faster than that of most others. However, it still relatively rarely jams (at least until its bar reaches around half or lower condition), in contrast to AKM-74/2U as an example, which already starts to frequently jam once its condition bar is only slightly depleted. Its accuracy, however, suffers greatly due to present unreliability, so the GP37, although being one of the most efficient weapons in game, is not suitable for longer use and should soon be replaced with a new one, if possible. The best way to save condition and accuracy with it as long as possible is to make headshots, since this generally requires only a round or few and is relatively easy to achieve due to high accuracy of the weapon and its integrated optical scope.', 'gp37.png');

This brings the point slight lower than the knife''s spine to produce a more pointed edge, which allows better control of the knife as well as better penetration. The grip is made of a metal and synthetic finish with the hilt sporting a bayonet lug. The other edge of the blade is serrated which is typically used for cutting objects rather than for combat. Oddly, the Hunting knife combines several features of different knives which includes the blade of a bowie knife in tandem with a sawback (typically utilized military-wise by combat/survival knives) and the hilt of a bayonet. Its appearance is similar to the Buck 184 Buckmaster.
The weapon possesses two attacks: "slashing attack" and "stabbing attack". The "slashing attack" is a fast attack which slows down the player if performed while running. If targeted at the head it would disorient the target and two slashes at the head can put any human opponent down. The "stabbing attack" deals the most damage and can slay most targets in one attack if stabbed at the head or disorient the target if stabbed at the body. This attack performs slower than a "slashing attack" and has a slightly lower range compared to the "slash". On the other hand, when this attack is performed it does not slow down the player in the middle of running.

The weapon operates by accelerating bullets to extremely high speeds using a system of electromagnets, which provides incredible stopping power with virtually no recoil. The weapon is powered by using capsulated artifact fragments in the batteries.
The first designs for the rifle came from a covert weapons research program in the Chernobyl Zone of Exclusion, before the Zone even came into being. The project that eventually birthed the Gauss rifle focused on creating weapons based on the principle of projectile acceleration via an electromagnetic field. Cardan, one future stalker, was one of contractors involved in its development, as a designer. The entire project was scrapped in 2004, as a compact-enough power source could not be found. The testing workshop in Zaton was sealed, with the test Gauss cannon and all documentation.

Unlike traditional firearms, the Gauss Rifle does not launch projectiles using combustion, but rather uses a series of electromagnets powered by fragments of a Flash artifact to fire special, ferromagnetic slugs at high speeds, capable of completely ignoring protective armor, even the armor of the Exoskeleton cannot stop a Gauss round at any range.

This setup makes it the epitome of sniping weapons, and excels in that role. With pinpoint accuracy, zero recoil, and almost invisible muzzle flash, the Gauss is perfect for sniping from any distance. However, the extreme damage of the shot is off-set by an extremely low rate of fire – it can only fire once every two seconds, and reloading adds another four seconds to the delay, the longest of any sniper rifle.', 'gauss_gun.png');

These qualities have earned it the admiration of countless stalkers.

The SVUmk-2 is a 7.62x54mm compact bullpup sniper rifle. It is primarily for either a player who needs a compact yet powerful sniper weapon or for urban firefights, where its short size will be more of an asset than a hindrance, or a player who would prefer to travel with a light yet powerful sniper weapon. Compared to its larger cousin, the SVDm-2, the SVU has shorter effective range, slightly lower damage, and accuracy, but is lighter, has less recoil, slightly faster fire rate, and still packs a sizable punch due to its large caliber.

In all games the magazine capacity is a standard 10 round, but it can be upgraded to 15 as a tier 1 upgrade in Call of Pripyat.

The SVUmk-2 is held by the snipers of the Freedom faction and some Monolith snipers along the pathways in the Red Forest. Members of the Freedom faction like Max and Skinflint use this weapon.

It has a lower damage per shot and accuracy than the full-size SVDm-2, but offers a much higher fire rate, making firing follow-up shots easier.

Highly rated by many stalkers despite its small magazine.
The Vintar BC is an automatic sniper rifle with an integral silencer/suppressor that uses 9×39mm ammo. It has high armor-piercing ability but its range is actually worse than that of most rifles due to its low-velocity subsonic rounds, which have considerable drop that must be factored in when firing at longer ranges. However, when used within its effective range it is a very powerful and accurate weapon. It is fairly light for a sniper rifle, easy to handle, has good accuracy and is generally cheaper to maintain and upgrade than the SVDm-2 or assault rifles converted for sniper use. In addition, its 4x magnification scope is superior to those of assault rifles, which only upgrade to 2x magnification. A drawback is its small 10-round magazine, causing the need to reload frequently in automatic fire. Despite these drawbacks, it is arguably the only sniper rifle in the game that can be effective when used properly at close ranges (high damage and high automatic fire rate), and can take down even the toughest enemies rapidly provided one can master its substantial recoil in fully automatic fire.
It is an effective weapon for mid-to-long-range sniping due to the good accuracy, although it suffers from bullet drop which renders the weapon not as effective as regular sniper rifles at long ranges.
